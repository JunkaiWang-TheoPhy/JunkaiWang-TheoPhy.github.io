summary: >-
  Using DESI DR2 hints of evolving dark energy, the work shows alignment with the
  Swampland Transplanckian Censorship Conjecture and uses swampland TCC criteria
  to constrain EoS parameterizations (CPL/BA/JBP/EXP/LOG) and test modified
  gravity, implying viable scenarios must asymptotically transition to
  deceleration.
