summary: >-
  As the youngest speaker to deliver a 30-min plenary talk, in this article we
  develop a compact framework for physics discourse using linguistic
  semiotics—Peirce’s sign–interpretant–object triad, Saussurean oppositions, and
  Hallidayan Systemic Functional Linguistics with multimodality—to model modern
  physics language as a structured, multimodal sign system. It operationalizes
  the framework via (i) a semiotic comparison of interpretations of quantum
  mechanics and (ii) an SFL/discourse analysis of Einstein’s 1905 On the
  Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies, yielding a reusable template for analyzing
  and standardizing scientific writing across languages.
