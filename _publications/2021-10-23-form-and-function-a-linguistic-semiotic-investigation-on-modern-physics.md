summary: >-
  Proposes a compact semiotic-SFL model for modern-physics discourse (Peirce's
  sign-object-interpretant triad; Saussurean oppositions; multimodal Systemic
  Functional Linguistics), tested via contrasts among quantum-mechanical
  interpretations and an SFL/discourse reading of Einstein (1905), yielding a
  reusable template for cross-lingual scientific-writing analysis.
