summary: >-
  From a TRAPPIST-1e observer's viewpoint, N-body integrations generate
  ephemerides and observable sky phenomena to assess what "discovering gravity"
  looks like in a compact exoplanet system; Keplerian regularities are readily
  testable, while relativistic effects (e.g., perihelion precession) are too
  small to stand out, suggesting GR would be hard to infer locally.
