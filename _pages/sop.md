I am applying to PSI and PSI Start program because I want the kind of high-density, research-adjacent training environment that forces a young theorist to integrate breadth with depth--across quantum field theory, gravity, quantum matter physics, quantum information, and AI for Science -- while being mentored inside a world-leading community. That would be really important for my future study of PhD and Postdoc, thus contributing better to the academy and society. Especially studies in Perimeter's PhD program if possible.

Born in a small historic city known as the hometown of Confucius, I grew up in an environment respecting knowledge. I've been determined to devote my life to humanity, from primary school to now. I have therefore been determined to become a fundamental scientist for more than 15 years, and hopefully lasting for my whole life according to Bayesian inference (LoL). I've promised I'll dedicated all my life to it.

I'm an enthusiast of (i) Quantum Matter (ii) Quantum Gravity (iii) Quantum Information (iv) AI for Fundamental Science. For more infomation please see my Statement of Interest:

While my interests are wide-ranging, in my deepest heart I am a fundamental theorist. My primary goal is to understand the structures of fundamental physics, especially in quantum gravity, and I spent the past four years dedicated to the study of them. Yet current trends in theoretical physics naturally draw me toward quantum matter physics, quantum information, symmetries, and topological phases. For example, many new insights into fundamental physical structures are entering the field through recent advances in quantum matter, which today plays a role comparable to what string theory did 30 years ago, quantum field theory 50 years ago, and QM & GR 100 years ago. As a youngster I think Ishould not ignore these developments, pretending they do not exist.

I believe mastering these tools is meaningful in its own right and also essential for uncovering the basic structure of nature. Insights from quantum matter and symmetry significantly reshaped my understanding of the fundamental physics of our universe. Also, I believe the physical principles underlying LLM are largely different from the physics of our universe, although it resembles statistical physics!

I have to mention that because of the Neurodiversity traits and the lack of formal theoretical physics groups in my undergraduate school, my transcript shows grade frictions and lack of advanced coursework, and therefore does not accurately reflect my true academic performance. However, I actively responded by building a rigorous self-study routine, seeking advanced lectures when available, and developing strategies to manage attention and communication. I seek peer discussion whenever possible and work productively in structured environments. Out of passion for fundamental science, I chose to become a visiting scholar after completing my undergraduate degree, and after 1 year co-advised in the Quantum Information Group & Mathematical Physics Group of Tsinghua University, now I am ready to contribute to graduate study and research projects.

In sum, my academic trajectory reflects the same principles I hope to crystallize strengths at PSI: the attitude towards academic excellence through understanding and self-motivation, an inclusion-minded way of working shaped by deliberate routines and communication, and a habit of collaboration and mentorship built through peer discussion and sustained outreach. I learn by producing various outputs, and I benefited a lot when surrounded by people who challenge assumptions and refine ideas into research-grade understanding. PSI is the environment where these traits translate most directly into impact, and my goal is to use the program to converge on a focused, PhD-ready research direction--ideally continuing into Perimeter's PhD program and contributing to the institute's research community over the long term.

Because of my distinctive undergraduate experience of lacking guidance, I believe that nurturing young scholars is just as important as doing scientific research, so I am always eager to share my insights and knowledge. Since undergrad, I have maintained a science outreach blog on theoretical physics: zhihu.com/people/Junkai-Wang (Chinese). It has attracted over 5,000,000+ views and has been awarded as "Best answerer in Physics" in 70/420,000,000 users, helping thousands of Chinese physics students and even faculty members in the past few years.

I am applying to the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics Perimeter Scholars International program because I want the kind of high-density, research-adjacent training environment that forces a young theorist to integrate breadth with depth--across quantum field theory, gravity, many-body physics, and quantum information--while being mentored inside a world-leading community. PSI's design as an intensive "physics boot camp," its emphasis on inclusive excellence, and its culture of collaboration and mentorship match how I have already trained myself: by seeking the strongest possible problems, peers, and guidance, and by treating learning as something to be *lived* rather than merely completed.  


My preparation for PSI is rooted in a deliberate trajectory: I completed my B.Sc. in Physics at Nanjing University and then continued as a visiting student to deepen my theoretical formation rather than "finish quickly." I am currently affiliated with Tsinghua University (co-advised by groups in quantum information and mathematical physics), and I have also held research/academic visiting experiences at University of Science and Technology of China (particle cosmology collaboration), University of California, Berkeley, and University of California, Santa Barbara. These moves reflect a consistent motive: when my local environment lacked the subfield support I needed, I crossed institutional boundaries to find the right intellectual ecosystem and to acquire research-level standards for rigor and taste.  


In terms of research direction, I am a fundamental theorist whose center of gravity is quantum gravity--but I am intentionally building the *adjacent toolchains* that modern quantum gravity now draws from: quantum many-body physics, generalized symmetries, quantum information, and computational/AI methods for physics. Concretely, my current interests include low-dimensional gravity (JT/3D gravity and its relation to TQFT/LQG), entanglement/complexity in holography and matrix-model-like systems, generalized (including non-invertible) symmetries across HEP and quantum matter, and learning-based or automated methods that can become genuinely scientific rather than merely heuristic. This cross-domain stance is not "breadth for its own sake": it is my attempt to track where conceptual progress actually enters the field today, and to be technically bilingual between communities that too often speak past each other.

My record shows both academic ambition and the habit of turning ideas into outputs. I have coauthored work spanning formal methods/AI-for-math (e.g., a benchmark suite for formal category theory in Lean) and physics (including cosmology-facing research connecting quantum-gravity-motivated constraints to observational tensions). I also actively communicate physics: I have a sustained outreach footprint, and I treat the act of explaining as a way to build inclusive pipelines for younger students who--like I once did--lack local mentorship. 

The PSI values resonate with my lived experience. **Academic excellence**: I am accustomed to accelerated self-study and to calibrating understanding against frontier seminars, workshops, and strong peers; I also seek environments where excellence is defined by clarity and depth, not by exam optimization. **Inclusion**: I am neurodivergent (ADHD, with mild Asperger's traits), and I have learned to convert constraints into working strategies--structured routines, careful collaboration habits, and deliberate communication. This makes me especially committed to inclusive excellence as a *performance multiplier* for the whole community, not a slogan. **Collaboration and mentorship**: my own path was transformed by mentors and peers who invested time in a young stranger; I now try to "return" that gift by organizing seminars/reading activities and by mentoring through open educational writing. **Creativity and innovation**: I gravitate toward questions that require building bridges--gravity <-> information, symmetry <-> phases of matter, computation <-> theory--and PSI's multi-area exposure is exactly the forcing function that can turn such bridging into mature research taste. 

Looking ahead, PSI is not an endpoint for me but a launchpad. I want to use PSI to (i) consolidate mastery of core graduate theory at speed, (ii) identify the most promising research "interfaces" where conceptual advances are currently happening, and (iii) produce a focused research project that can naturally transition into PhD-level work. If my research direction aligns well with Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics faculty and culture, I would be eager to continue into Perimeter's PhD path after PSI. PSI's structure--coursework integrated into an active research institute, in partnership with the University of Waterloo--is precisely the environment in which I can convert intensity and preparation into durable, publishable research progress.

Thank you for considering my application.
