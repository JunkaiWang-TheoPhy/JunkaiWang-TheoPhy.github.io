## Statement of Interest

This page collects a concise checklist aligned with PSI Start application requirements and a sample Statement of Interest draft. The checklist is for self-audit; the draft below is a working example that I continue to refine.

## PSI Start SoI Checklist (2-page maximum)

### A. Hard constraints
- Maximum length: 2 pages.
- Required online application material alongside CV, transcripts, and letters.
- Consistency with CV and transcripts for projects, dates, and outputs.

### B. Evaluation dimensions
The program and recommendation letters emphasize:
- Motivation: why PSI Start, and why now.
- Abilities: evidence you can execute research tasks independently.
- Academic background: core coursework and self-study that support your direction.
- Collaboration: evidence of teamwork, reading groups, coauthorship, or cross-institution work.

### C. Recommended two-page structure
- Opening 4 to 6 lines: one-sentence focus + why PSI Start, why now.
- Research interests: 1 core problem family, 3 to 6 keywords, and a clear boundary of scope.
- Preparation and evidence: 2 to 3 strongest projects with role, tools, and outputs.
- Fit with PSI Start: concrete match to program mechanism and research ecosystem.
- Collaboration and community: brief evidence of group work and intellectual exchange.
- Deliverables: three time points (e.g., week 2 memo, midterm talk, final report + code).
- Optional context: only if needed, in a short, factual note.

### D. Evidence standard
- Every strong claim should be anchored by a concrete project, course, note, or output.
- Prefer verifiable outputs: preprints, code, slides, technical notes.
- Avoid broad lists of fields without problem-method-result specificity.

### E. Common pitfalls
- Exceeding 2 pages or shrinking fonts/margins to force content.
- Grand narrative with no concrete projects or outputs.
- Flattery without a clear plan or deliverables.
- Research interests that are too broad or unfocused.

### F. Consistency with CV and letters
- Projects in the SoI should appear in the CV with matching dates and outputs.
- The SoI should make it easy for referees to comment on abilities, motivation, background, and collaboration.

## Draft Statement of Interest (Sample)

### Research interests and preparation
My first four years of undergraduate study built a solid foundation in mathematics and fundamental physics. This preparation lets me engage more confidently with quantum information, quantum matter, and AI-related physics.

This draft Statement of Interest was completed independently within three hours without outside assistance or online lookup. I include this note because it reflects my ability to synthesize ideas quickly and clearly from my existing knowledge base.

### Core themes I want to explore

#### Quantum matter and generalized symmetries
Recent work over the last five years shows that generalized symmetries are not a minor extension of conventional symmetry breaking. They reveal rich structures beyond traditional phases, including intrinsic and topological features. A course I took in winter 2025 deepened my understanding of these ideas and their implications. I am particularly interested in how these symmetry structures connect to questions in high-energy physics.

Although my interests are broad, I see myself as a foundational theorist. My central goal is to understand the structure of fundamental physics, especially quantum gravity. At the same time, the current wave of progress in quantum many-body physics, quantum information, symmetry, and topological phases provides essential tools that I do not want to ignore. These tools are valuable not only within their own domains but also for understanding the basic structure of nature.

#### AI for Physics, Physics for AI, Physics of AI
In the philosophy of science, physics has often evolved through two complementary paradigms: theory-first development and empiricism-first exploration. I see AI research as moving between similar modes. This motivates a physics-inspired approach to AI that is both conceptual and practical.

I believe AI is its own discipline with distinct laws, and direct analogies from fundamental physics can be misleading. To understand the physics of AI, especially emergent behavior in large models, we need new physical tools.

Directions I want to pursue include:
- Physics of AI: develop physical models that capture the behavior of large language models and neural networks.
- Physics for AI: use physical principles to design stronger AI infrastructure and learning systems.
- AI for Physics: leverage machine learning to accelerate discovery and analysis in fundamental physics.

Short-term, I want to study entanglement-like scaling and structure in transformer and diffusion architectures to better understand why these models are so powerful. I also want to build simplified toy models that capture key emergent behaviors in large systems.

### Why my path differs from most students
My knowledge base and research trajectory are not typical for students at my stage. I have pursued a highly self-directed route into theoretical physics.

- Tension between ambition and undergraduate resources: I have wanted to study fundamental theoretical physics since my first year. My undergraduate institution had limited formal training in mathematical physics, no theory group, and few advanced courses. I compensated through intensive self-study, including frequent all-night reading and problem sessions in my first year.
- Neurodiversity: I live with ADHD and Asperger's. These traits shaped my early years and made social interaction challenging. Over time I learned to work with these traits rather than against them, channeling focus and intensity into research.

A childhood memory captures this mindset: while riding on the back of my mother's bicycle, I asked, "Mom, how can I stop thinking?" She brushed it off, but for me it captured a mind that was already overactive and searching. Today I have learned to direct that energy in a constructive way. I see this as part of who I am as a physicist.
