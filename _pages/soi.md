I'm an enthusiast of:
- Quantum Matter
- Quantum Gravity
- Quantum Information
- AI for Fundamental Science

## What kind of topics am I interested in?
My first four undergraduate years gave me a solid foundation in mathematics, physics, and the core disciplines of fundamental physics. This helps me engage more confidently with quantum information, quantum matter, and AI for physics.

I am a fundamental theorist at heart. My primary goal is to understand the structures of fundamental physics, especially in quantum gravity. Yet the current era naturally draws me toward quantum many-body physics, quantum information, symmetries, and topological phases. As a young researcher, I should not ignore these directions. I believe mastering these tools is meaningful in their own right and also essential for uncovering the basic structure of nature. Insights from quantum many-body and symmetry research have already deepened my understanding of possible fundamental structures beyond existing paradigms.

Some topics I am actively working on and care about:
- Quantum Matter
  - Application of mixed states, strong symmetry, and strong-to-weak in AdS/CFT and quantum gravity
  - Tensor networks and quantum complexity
  - Generalized symmetry in 2d CFT and quantum gravity
  - Matrix models and fuzzy spheres
- Quantum Gravity
  - Scattering amplitudes and their relation to entanglement
  - Timelike entanglement in low-dimensional quantum gravity (e.g., JT)
  - Low-dimensional gravity: 3d gravity with its relation to LQG and TQFT; 2d gravity (BF, JT)
  - Late-time cosmology, such as dynamical dark energy and the swampland
- Quantum Information
  - Quantum automated learning
  - Quantum artificial intelligence
- AI for Fundamental Science
  - Physics models for large-model behavior (scaling laws, complexity, entanglement)
  - Using deep learning to understand physics
  - Developing scientific agents
  - Using neural networks to study HEPT models based on non-relativistic string and matrix string

## Working with neurodiversity and overcoming it
In primary and middle school I don't dare to ask a question in front of the class.
I have ADHD and mild Asperger's traits, and my undergraduate program lacks a formal theoretical physics group. This created early social friction and limited access to advanced theory courses. I responded by building a rigorous self-study routine, seeking advanced lectures when available, and developing strategies to manage attention and communication. I seek peer discussion whenever possible and work productively in structured environments, and I am ready to contribute in collaborative research teams.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be grateful for the opportunity to join PSI Start, learn within Perimeter's research community, and contribute through focused, reproducible research outputs.

Sincerely,
