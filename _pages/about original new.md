Welcome to my playground! 🤓
I'm mostly active on Q&A platform as a Theoretical Physics Answer on Zhihu (StackExchange in China), and is one of 70 优秀答主 in Physics among 400 millon users.  Some 代表作 has been translated into English in my Blog(link here).

I'm a theoretical physics student researching quantum gravity and cosmology. Let's unite to make human science brighter and stride bravely into tomorrow! ✨

"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much" —— Helen Keller  
**How to memorize me**: my first name "Jun-Kai" in Chinese means "talented" and "triumph", and my last name "Wang" means "King".
Call me "Julian K. Wang" if you'd like! I revere Caesar & Schwinger.
