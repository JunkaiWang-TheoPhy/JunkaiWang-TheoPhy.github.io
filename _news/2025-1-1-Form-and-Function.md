**Form & Function: A Linguistic-Semiotic Investigation on Modern Physics**: Develops a compact framework for physics discourse using linguistic semiotics—Peirce’s *sign–interpretant–object* triad, Saussurean oppositions, and Hallidayan Systemic Functional Linguistics with multimodality—to model modern physics language as a structured, multimodal sign system. It operationalizes the framework via (i) a semiotic comparison of interpretations of quantum mechanics and (ii) an SFL/discourse analysis of Einstein’s 1905 *On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies*, yielding a reusable template for analyzing and standardizing scientific writing across languages.
